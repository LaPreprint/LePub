Now the only thing that is left is to make your template available to the rest of the world!

## Typst

We would recommend that you add your template to the Typst Universe to make it easy for others to use it.

1. Fork the [`typst/packages`](https://github.com/typst/packages) repository
2. Clone it locally (`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packages`)
3. Copy the contents of your `typst` folder (in your template) to `packages/preview`
4. Commit your changes and open a PR

## Quarto

Easy piezy, it's already available for everyone to use like specified in [our Quarto docs](quarto.md).

## MyST

1. On your Github repository, add `myst-template` as a [topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository)
2. Fork the [`myst-templates/templates`](https://github.com/myst-templates/templates) repository
3. Add your template information to the `data/typst.yml` file
4. Commit your changes and open a PR
