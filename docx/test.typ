      #strong[Abstract:] Across the animal kingdom, individuals have
      been shown to show consistent individual differences (CID) in
      their levels of activity. However, activity can be measured on
      multiple timescales, and measures of activity are commonly
      reported without reference to the timescale. As a result, little
      is known about how the timescale affects the conclusions and
      whether environmental effects affect activity CIDs selectively.
      Here we record activity of the ground beetle, #emph[Nebria
      brevicollis] (Fabricius, 1793), over 24 hours twice, two weeks
      apart. This experiment was repeated in three different lighting
      conditions, 12:12 light/darkness, continuous light and continuous
      darkness. We used a hierarchical activity segmentation method to
      label activity states on both a slow timescale (active state vs.
      passive state) and on a fast timescale (moving vs. idle). This
      allowed us to quantify levels of activity on both the slow
      timescale as the proportion of time spent in the active state, and
      on the fast timescale as the proportion of time spent moving in
      both the active and passive state separately. We find that ground
      beetles exhibit CIDs in activity on both timescales. We also find
      that continuous darkness decreases CIDs especially on the slow
      timescale. Finally, we show that the activity proportion and the
      movement proportion during active states are uncorrelated. Our
      findings highlight the need to consider the hierarchical nature of
      behaviour when quantifying CIDs and makes a novel distinction
      between two measures of activity.
